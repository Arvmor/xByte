# xByte SDK

Infra for Pay-per-Byte Monetization

TypeScript SDK for pay-per-byte content monetization through x402 payments. Enable content creators to monetize their content on a per-byte basis. Perfect for audio, video, and file streaming.

## What is xByte?

xByte is a decentralized infrastructure protocol that allows content creators to monetize their content (audio, video, files, etc.) on a per-byte basis. Users pay for exactly what they consume using x402 payment authorization, enabling micro-payments for content streaming.

## Features

- **Pay-per-byte monetization**: Set prices for your content and get paid for every byte consumed
- **x402 payment integration**: Seamless payment authorization using the x402 standard
- **EVM contract support**: Interact with xByte smart contracts on Base Sepolia
- **Type-safe SDK**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **Simple API**: Easy-to-use client interfaces for both API and blockchain interactions

## SDK Components

The xByte SDK consists of two main clients:

1. **xByteClient**: Interact with the xByte API server for content management and retrieval
2. **xByteEvmClient**: Interact with xByte smart contracts on the blockchain

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { xByteClient } from "xbyte-sdk";

const client = new xByteClient();

const health = await client.health();
console.log(health); // { status: "Success", data: "OK" }
```

## Quick Installation

```bash
npm install xbyte-sdk
```
